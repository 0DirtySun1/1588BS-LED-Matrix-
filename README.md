Creating any 8x8 LED Pattern you desire is just the beginning of the functionality of the 1588BS 8x8 LED Matrix, 
when done this Project lets you experiment with your Matrix its easy to use and for your freetime there is snake 
implemented. It comes in handy if you loose your phone on the bus. Just wipe out your Arduino board with the Matrix
attached an your ready to go (don't forget to load onto the board beforehand).

For my sources i used https://projecthub.arduino.cc/joeljojop/snake-game-cb6241 but since i had no module for the MAX7219 IC
chip so i improvised with two breadboards and a whole bunch of cables.

Here is a list of the parts you need to build this project on your own:
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 2x MAX7219 IC
- 10x-30x jumper wires (depending on if you're using the chip driver for LED Matrix or not)
- 1x Analog Joystick
- 2x Breadboards
- Power Supply (9v battery or PC (5v))
